# Quickstart guide

No time to read everything, here is how to start
using the package:

Make sure that:
* taxidTools is installed
* You have a local copy of the [NCBI taxdump files](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/)

While you can use the package with other taxonomy definitions (or none!),
using the Taxdump files is the easiest solution.

## Loading taxonomy information

Start by importing taxidTools:

``` py
>>> import taxidTools
```

Then load the taxdump files that you saved and unpacked locally:

``` py
>>> tax = taxidTools.read_taxdump(
        "path/to/nodes.dmp", 
        "path/to/rankedlineage.dmp",
        "path/to/merged.dmp"
)
```

Parsing the whole files can take a moment! 
Speeding up this process will be discussed in the [advanced usage](advances.md) section.

The nodes.dmp and rankedlineage.dmp are the only files you need
from the taxdump archive. 

Note that you can skip some of the taxonomy divisions while reading the taxonomy file by using the `skip_synth` and `skip_env` arguments.

## Accessing node infos

A Taxonomy object contains a bunch of nodes that represent
individual branchings or organisms within the clasification.

Each node has three basic properties:
* A unique identifier (taxid)
* A name, scientific or common. Beware that these names are not 
nescessarily unique and may be shared by several nodes.
* A rank, representing where this node is place in the taxonomy.
Some ranks are unique (e.g. species or genus) but some other appear
at different heights in the Taxonomy (e.g. clade or the well named norank).

Additionally each node has a single parent, the node directly above it in
the Taxonomy, and can have any number of children. The only parent-less node
is refered to as root node and represents the top of the taxonomy.

All these properties can be easily accessed, using the taxid number:

``` py
>>> tax.getName('9606')
'Homo sapiens'
>>> tax.getRank('9606')
'species'
>>> tax.getParent('9606')
Node(9605)
>>> tax.getChildren('9606')
[Node(63221), Node(744458)]
```

It is also possible to etrieve the taxid number for a name. However be careful that
this can lead to unexpected results if the names are not unique!

``` py
>>> tax.getTaxid('Homo sapiens')
'9606'
>>> tax.addNode(Node(taxid = 0, name = 'Homo sapiens'))
>>> tax.getTaxid('Homo sapiens')
'0'
```

You probably notices that some methodes return a Node object. 
These are the basic objects containing all of the node information. 
Actually the Taxonomy object is just a dictionnary of Nodes.
You can access a Node object directly by passing its taxid as a key
to a Taxonomy object and retrieve the Node properties:

``` py
>>> hs = tax.get('9606')
>>> hs.name
'Homo sapiens'
>>> hs.rank
'species'
>>> hs.parent
Node(9605)
>>> hs.parent.name
'Homo'
>>> [node.name for node in hs.children]
['Homo sapiens neanderthalensis', "Homo sapiens subsp. 'Denisova'"]
```

## Ancestries

It is possible to test directly the relationships betwen two nodes.
Note that a Node is neither an ancestor or descendant of itself.

``` py
>>> tax.isDescendantOf('9606', '9605')
True
>>> tax.isAncestorOf('9606', '9605')
False
>>> tax.isAncestorOf('9606', '9606')
False
```

It is also possible to retrieve the whole ancestry of a given node. 
Ancestries are stored in list-like Lineage objects, Nodes indices follow 
the taxonomy order.

``` py
>>> lin = tax.getAncestry('9606')
>>> lin[0]
Node(9606)
>>> len(lin)
32
```

It is possible to filter a Lineage for specific ranks:

``` py
>>> lin.filter(['genus', 'family'])
>>> lin
Lineage([Node(9605), Node(9604)])
```

This mutates the Lineage object, if you want to keep the object intact
you should use list comprehensions to filter specific nodes:

``` py
>>> lin = tax.getAncestry('9606')
>>> [node for node in lin if node.rank in ['genus', 'family']]
[Node(9605), Node(9604)]
>>> len(lin)
32
```

Now that you know the basic functions of taxidTools, you are ready 
for the [advanced uses](advanced.md).
